Electro Bus Location Tracker App

This will be a Bus Location Tracker for use at Tec de Monterrey - Campus Monterrey by students and professor.

There is currently a gasoline based bus who services the academic community and takes them to the Campus.
It has several stops distributed along the city.

As part of the renovation of bus as an electric bus, there is interest to digitalize its operation, by counting how many users get up and down.

### That is how the Electrobus Location Tracker App project was borned

There will be two types of users:
  
    -Passenger
    -Driver
    
The driver will share its current location (posting his coordinates on Firebase) and each Passenger will retrieve them and see the current bus location on a map.
